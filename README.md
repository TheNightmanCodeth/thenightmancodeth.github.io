Joe's Blog
-------------------

Hello, this is the source code repository for my blog and custom [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) theme!

Right now it's a work in progress. Eventually, though, I hope to have it working with github pages using github actions ðŸ¤ž.

# The theme
--------------------
If you take a look at `blog/Sources/Blog/BlogTheme.swift` you can see just how easy it is to get started making your own custom `Publish` theme! I tried other static site generators like `Hugo` and `VuePress` but I just feel right at home using `Publish`. It's very similar to `SwiftUI` actually thanks to [Plot](https://github.com/johnsundell/plot). I hope once my theme is complete I can publish it and contribute to the growing `Publish` ecosystem.
