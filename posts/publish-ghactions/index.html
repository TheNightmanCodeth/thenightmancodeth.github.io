While this article isn‚Äôt about that, I highly recommend using Publish if you‚Äôre a Swift developer looking for a good static site generator!</p><p>While <code>Publish</code> comes with a built-in deployment function that works with GH Pages, <em>I</em> couldn't get it to work. It looks like it really only works if you‚Äôre deploying to a separate repository. Even then, a lot of us wish to automatically trigger a publish on each new blog post or git commit. I spent some time yesterday messing with GitHub Actions and put together a build script that can do just that.</p><h2>The Process</h2><p>I started off trying to simply spin up a macOS machine, cloning my repo, installing the <code>publish</code> command line tool from <code>homebrew</code>, generating the <code>HTML</code> and pushing that to my GitHub Pages branch.</p><p>This proved to be a bit of a hassle. GitHub actions uses a version of macOS that is too old to work with the <code>publish</code> command line tool that is available through <code>homebrew</code>.</p><p>‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just build the command line tool from the source code.‚Äù Well, that didn‚Äôt work either. I was missing some swift concurrency libraries on the worker machine. That meant, I assume, the version of <code>Swift</code> on the GH Actions build machine was too old ‚òπÔ∏è.</p><p>At this point I considered giving up, until I remembered <code>Swift</code> is cross platform! üéâüéâ</p><p>I set the runner to use <code>ubuntu-latest</code> instead of <code>macOS-latest</code> and got to thinking.</p><p>On <code>Ubuntu</code> the steps would be a bit different. First and foremost I‚Äôd need to install <code>Swift</code>. Luckily there exists an action on the GitHub Actions Marketplace called <code>[Install Swift on Linux](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-swift-on-linux)</code> which does just that: installs Swift on a Linux worker on Github Actions! Lucky day!</p><p>After Swift was installed I‚Äôd need to either get the <code>publish</code> command line tool building on Linux or figure out a way to build the project some other way. ü§û</p><p>Luckily (spoiler alert) the <code>publish</code> tool compiled and installed just fine on Ubuntu.</p><p>The last step was to push the resulting <code>Output</code> directory to my GitHub pages branch on my repo. Luckily there exists an awesome action on the GitHub Marketplace that makes doing that extremely easy. It‚Äôs called <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages">Deploy to GitHub Pages</a> and it works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we‚Äôve outlined the approach let‚Äôs get to making the workflow!</p><h2>Before we start...</h2><p>This will <em>not</em> be a GitHub Pages tutorial. In order to follow along here, you should already have GitHub Pages setup using one of your repos. You can check out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">Creating a GitHub Pages Site</a> article for more info. Basically you'll create a new repository, name it <code>&lt;yourgithubusername&gt;.github.io</code> and configure the settings there.</p><h2>Creating the Workflow</h2><p>To get started creating the workflow we‚Äôll open up a terminal and <code>cd</code> into our project‚Äôs root directory.</p><p>Once there, we create the directory <code>.github/workflows</code> and create a new file inside there called <code>main.yml</code>.</p><pre><code>mkdir -p .<span class="dotAccess">github</span>/workflows
touch .<span class="dotAccess">github</span>/workflows/main.<span class="property">yml</span>
</code></pre><p>Now we open up our favorite text editor and start configuring our workflow!</p><pre><code>nvim .<span class="dotAccess">github</span>/workflows/main.<span class="property">yml</span>
</code></pre><p>First, we name our workflow:</p><pre><code>name: <span class="type">Deploy</span> to <span class="type">GitHub Pages</span>
</code></pre><p>Next, we trigger the workflow when the branch with our source code receives a push. In my case, the source code for my blog is located on the <code>Publish</code> branch.</p><pre><code>on:
  push:
    branches: [ ‚Äú<span class="type">Publish</span>‚Äù ]
</code></pre><p>Finally we begin the actual workflow. First we tell the worker to use <code>ubuntu-latest</code> and use the marketplace action mentioned above to install the latest version of <code>Swift</code>.</p><pre><code>jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: <span class="type">Install Swift</span>
        uses: sersoft-gmbh/swifty-linux-action@v1
        with:
          release-version: <span class="number">5.6.2</span>
</code></pre><p>With our worker configured and swift installed we can move on to the next step: installing the <code>publish</code> command line tool.</p><p>Inside of the <code>steps</code> section we add the following:</p><pre><code>- name: <span class="type">Install Publish</span>
  run: |
    git clone https://github.<span class="property">com</span>/<span class="type">JohnSundell</span>/<span class="type">Publish</span>.<span class="property">git</span>
    cd <span class="type">Publish</span>
    make
</code></pre><p>Now we can pull our repo to the worker and generate our static website!</p><pre><code>       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: <span class="type">Generate</span> site
        run: |
          cd <span class="property">$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</span>/blog/
          publish generate
</code></pre><p>A few things are going on here. First we use the <code>checkout</code> action from GitHub that pulls our repo from the branch that this <code>main.yml</code> is located on. The <code>checkout</code> action pulls the source code to <code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code>, so we <code>cd</code> to that path. In my case, the source code is located inside of a subdirectory called <code>blog</code>, so I change directories to <code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/blog</code>. Once inside that directory we call <code>publish generate</code> to generate our static website.</p><p>Lastly we‚Äôll use the <code>github-pages-deploy-action</code> to deploy our static site to our GitHub Pages branch!</p><pre><code>         - name: <span class="type">Deploy</span> site
          uses: <span class="type">JamesIves</span>/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
            with:
              branch: master
              folder: blog/<span class="type">Output</span>
</code></pre><p>And just like that, our workflow is complete! In the last step we tell the <code>github-pages-deploy-action</code> which branch to deploy to, you might set this to <code>gh-pages</code> depending on your configuration. Then we tell it where our static site is located. In my case it‚Äôs located in the <code>Output</code> folder inside of the <code>blog</code> folder inside of the root of my repo. Yours might just be <code>folder: Output</code>.</p><p>After all of that, your <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code> file should look something like this:</p><pre><code>

name: <span class="type">Deploy</span> to <span class="type">GHPages</span>

on:
  push:
    branches: [ <span class="string">"Publish"</span> ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: <span class="type">Install Swift</span>
        uses: sersoft-gmbh/swifty-linux-action@v1
        with:
          release-version: <span class="number">5.6.2</span>

      - name: <span class="type">Install Publish</span>
        run: |
          git clone https://github.<span class="property">com</span>/<span class="type">JohnSundell</span>/<span class="type">Publish</span>.<span class="property">git</span>
          cd <span class="type">Publish</span>
          make

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: <span class="type">Generate</span> site
        run: |
          cd <span class="property">$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</span>/blog/
          publish generate

      - name: <span class="type">Publish</span> site
        uses: <span class="type">JamesIves</span>/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: master
          folder: blog/<span class="type">Output</span>
</code></pre><p>Now commit and push that file to your repo and go to the <code>actions</code> tab.</p><img src="/img/ghactions.png" alt="GitHub Actions"/></div><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
